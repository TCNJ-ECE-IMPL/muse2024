# How to run

Run new_experiment.sh, which will prompt for a name for the experiment. This will copy the files in /src/ and /tdms_data/, as well as any new files needed to run a new test. Optuna will automatically be run.

The new experiment will be in the /experiments/ folder.

# Contents of the experiment folder:

/tdms_data/: 
Data obtained from NI Virtual Lab software. Copied from the tdms_data directory in the root of the repository

/src/:

/checkpoints/:
